# tic-tac-toe
In this program, tic-tac-toe game which is called 'Dose' in persian, is simulated using random numbers that are generated automatically. The main difference here is that instead of asking one of the two users to play their game every time, the program randomly chooses a specific move for each one and performs it.

Hints:
a. The game board is 9x9.
b. After each move for two players, the game board is printed (after the board is printed, "***" sign also is added for better spacing).
C. The selected place for the first and second player is indicated by 1 and 2 respectively on the page.
d. If the game has a winner in every stage, the winner of the game is determined, but if the game has no winner after 9 possible moves, the command "no winner" is printed.
e. The first move is always chosen for the first player.
